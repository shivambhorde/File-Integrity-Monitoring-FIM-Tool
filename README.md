# File-Integrity-Monitoring-FIM-Tool
This tool
continuously checks for any changes, deletions, or additions to files and compares the current checksum or hash values with the original values stored in ”baseline.txt.” In case of any discrepancies, it generates detailed logs and stores them on the virtual machine, while also automatically backing up the original files at regular intervals and managing storage by deleting previous backups. The primary aim of the FIM tool is to maintain file integrity and
promptly notify system administrators of any suspicious activities, thereby ensuring a secure operating environment.
