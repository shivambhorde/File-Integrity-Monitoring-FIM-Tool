"Securing systems SIEM and FIM Tool":
SIEM uses azure monitoring agent which inject data from virtual machine into log analytics workspace and then the raw data extracted in log analytics. After extraction of the raw data, it is used for representation in graph or any other form on azure sentinel workbook, and also for alert generation. FIM is running a python script which monitors multiple folder/directories. All types of file are monitored in FIM with any file extension. First it stores hash of all the files which is to be monitored in file named "baseline.txt". Also backup of the original file is automatically taken. After specific time interval, the old backup is deleted and new is stored. When any user gets unauthorized access to the file, he may create new file or deleted file or change the content of the file. Any activity performed by any authorized or unauthorized will be listed with event id, the path of the file, date and time of event happened and what action is performed is stored in the log file with '.log' extension. This log file is then automatically sent to SIEM tool for representation and alert generation.
