# File-Integrity-Monitoring-FIM-Tool
FIM runs a Python script to monitor multiple folders/directories and all file types. It stores file hashes in "baseline.txt" and automatically backs up original files, deleting old backups at set intervals. Unauthorized access or changes are logged with event ID, file path, date, time, and action in a ".log" file
